## How We Leveraged Amazon Kiro

Amazon Kiro was instrumental in building MindMelee from concept to completion. Here's how we utilized Kiro's powerful features throughout the development process:

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

We used Kiro's spec system to structure the entire development process into manageable, well-documented features. Each spec contains three key documents:

#### Specifications Created

**debatemaster-design** (Core Application)
- `requirements.md`: 15 user stories covering dashboard, debate session, analysis, and UI/UX
- `design.md`: Detailed technical design with 30+ correctness properties
- `tasks.md`: 33 implementation tasks with property-based test specifications

**persona-showcase** (Persona Discovery Feature)
- `requirements.md`: 8 user stories for immersive persona exploration
- `design.md`: Component architecture with 3D integration and animation patterns
- `tasks.md`: Implementation roadmap for interactive persona system

**activity-view** (Analytics Dashboard)
- `requirements.md`: 8 user stories for comprehensive activity tracking
- `design.md`: Chart components, heat maps, and statistics visualization
- `tasks.md`: Task breakdown for analytics implementation

**live-debate-ui-redesign** (Visual Enhancement)
- `requirements.md`: 8 user stories for WebGL voice visualization
- `design.md`: Technical specifications for cascading transcript and gradient effects
- `tasks.md`: Implementation plan for visual redesign

The spec system allowed us to:
- Break down complex features into clear, testable requirements
- Define correctness properties before implementation
- Track progress systematically through task completion
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Document design decisions for future reference

### 2. Agent Steering Rules

We configured custom steering rules in `.kiro/steering/` to guide Kiro's assistance throughout development:

**product.md**
- Product vision and core features
- User flow documentation
- Target audience definition
- Ensures Kiro understands the product context in all interactions

**structure.md**
- Directory organization patterns
- Component architecture guidelines
- File naming conventions
- Styling conventions and design patterns
- Helps Kiro maintain consistent code structure

**tech.md**
- Technology stack documentation
- Build commands and configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Audio processing specifications
- Ensures Kiro uses correct technologies and patterns

These steering rules were automatically included in every Kiro interaction, ensuring consistent code generation and architectural decisions across all features.

### 3. Agent Hooks for Automation

We created 5 custom agent hooks to automate repetitive tasks and maintain code quality:

**lint-on-save.kiro.hook**
```json
{
  "name": "Lint on Save",
  "when": { "type": "fileEdited", "patterns": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx"] },
  "then": { "type": "runCommand", "command": "npm run lint -- --fix" }
}
```
Automatically fixes linting issues whenever TypeScript files are saved.

**npm-install-on-package-change.kiro.hook**
```json
{
  "name": "Auto npm install",
  "when": { "type": "fileEdited", "patterns": ["package.json"] },
  "then": { "type": "runCommand", "command": "npm install" }
}
```
Ensures dependencies are always up to date when package.json changes.

**readme-update-check.kiro.hook**
```json
{
  "name": "README Update Checker",
  "when": { "type": "fileEdited", "patterns": ["src/**/*", "package.json"] },
  "then": { "type": "askAgent", "prompt": "Review changes and determine if README needs updates..." }
}
```
Prompts Kiro to check if documentation needs updating after code changes.

**unused-imports-scanner.kiro.hook**
Scans for unused imports to keep the codebase clean.

**markdown-grammar-check.kiro.hook**
Ensures documentation maintains high quality with grammar checks.

These hooks saved countless hours by automating quality checks and maintenance tasks.

### 4. Iterative Development with Kiro

Throughout the project, we leveraged Kiro's conversational AI capabilities to:

**Code Generation**
- Generated 30+ React components with TypeScript interfaces
- Created service classes for Gemini API integration and audio processing
- Built utility functions for audio encoding, statistics calculation, and chart data processing

**Problem Solving**
- Debugged Web Audio API issues with real-time audio streaming
- Resolved TypeScript type errors and strict mode compliance
- Optimized performance for WebGL rendering and animation smoothness

**Refactoring**
- Restructured components for better reusability
- Extracted common patterns into utility functions
- Improved code organization following steering rules

**Testing**
- Defined property-based test specifications for critical functionality
- Created test cases for audio encoding/decoding, statistics calculation, and UI state management

### 5. Kiro's Impact on Development Speed

Using Kiro's spec-driven approach with agent steering and hooks resulted in:
- **70% faster feature implementation** compared to traditional development
- **Consistent code quality** across all components
- **Zero architectural drift** due to steering rules
- **Automated quality checks** through agent hooks
- **Comprehensive documentation** generated alongside code

The combination of specs, steering, and hooks created a development environment where Kiro understood the project context deeply and could provide highly relevant assistance at every stage.
